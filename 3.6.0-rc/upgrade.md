# Upgrade

## Overview

From version 3.5.0, both installing and upgrading with the installer has been simplified. Upgrade differs from Install in that you run an installer diff to discover the differences between the old and new versions and then installer deploy for the new version.

Some guidance from Sysdig Support may be warranted in highly customized installations. 

Refer to the appropriate workflow, depending on your environment:

  - [Quickstart Install](README.md#quickstart-install)
  - [Airgapped Installation Options](README.md#airgapped-installation-options)
